### Description

**Proxy Scrapper CLI** is a **c**ommand **l**ine **i**nterface application written in Python that extracts information about proxies from [this website](http://www.freeproxylists.net) and save them as a `json` or `xml` file in the local [export](export/) folder. 

### Web Scrapping Approach

Due to the web scrapping sensitivity nature of such web site, the chosen approach was to simulate a human navigation pattern by opening requests through a web browser client (selenium + geckodriver) and firing click events on page links (`<a>` tags) in order to extract information from the other pages of the web site.

**prox_crapper**, when set locally, requires the following dependencies:
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-release)
- [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [Firefox geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) (*download the geckodriver according to your platform and save it under `/usr/bin` for Linux machine or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts\` for Windows machine. To further reading: [geckodriver binary setup](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers))
